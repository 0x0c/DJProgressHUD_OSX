DJProgressHUD_osx
=================

Progress and Activity HUD for OSX.

I am really excited to introduce this ProgressHUD for osx. When I started my first osx app, I noticed that there was not good alternative to SVProgressHUD for the mac. Because this is a such a great tool for displaying a process, I decided to write it for the mac. 

Whats included: 
  - DJProgressHUD: A class to show a popup view to the user displaying the current progress or an activity indicator.
  - DJActivityIndicator: A customizable activity indicator. The mac's version, NSProgressIndicator, just doesn't cut it.
  - DJProgressIndicator: A customizable circular progress view. Change the thickness, radius, size and color. I couldnt find one for the mac. So again, I made one.

Credit where credit is due:
  I modeled much of my code off of SVProgressHUD. Its a great project.
